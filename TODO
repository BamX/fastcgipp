THINGS TO DO
 * Add additional SQL engines (sqlite, postgresql, mssql) to ASql.
 * Use template specialization to improve Request::emptyBuffer().
 * Solve the ipv6 incompatibility without bloating or degrading performance.
   This is really just an issue with the Fastcgipp::Http::Address class.
 * Add the ability to fillPosts() to handle non utf-8 character sets when
   wchar_t is used as the Request template parameter. Possibly through iconv.
 * Somehow union/reference together the value and filename members of the
   Fastcgipp::Http::Post<charT> class. Only one will be used at a time so it is
   a waste of memory to have both but too confusing if they share a name.
