THINGS TO DO
 * Make the upload example work
 * Make a class to assist in the creation of HTTP headers
 * Add additional SQL engines (sqlite, postgresql, mssql)
 * Create file fetching class
 * Replace boost::_1... with boost::arg<1>...
 * Pull Fcgibuf out of Fcgistream
 * Use template specialization to improve Request::emptyBuffer()
 * Solve the ipv6 incompatibility without bloating or degrading performance.
 * Change fillPosts() to handle both multipart/form-data and
   application/x-www-form-urlencoded and pass unrecognized content to
   virtualized processPostData().
 * Add the ability to fillPosts() to handle non utf-8 character sets when
   wchar_t is used as the Request template parameter. Possibly through iconv.
 * Standardize some exceptions for client data parsing errors and generate
   appropriate HTTP status responses upon catch.
